### Description
Mr. Crinkles Memory Game is a fun and interactive browser-based matching game. Players flip over cards to find matching pairs of Mr. Crinkles images within a limited time. The game offers three levels of difficulty, each with a different number of pairs and a corresponding countdown timer.

### Features
- **Difficulty Levels**:
  - Easy: 6 pairs with a 60-second timer.
  - Medium: 12 pairs with a 90-second timer.
  - Hard: 20 pairs with a 120-second timer.
- **Card Matching**: Players flip two cards at a time and try to find matching pairs.
- **Points System**: Players earn 10 points for each successful match.
- **Persistent Matched Cards**: Matched cards remain face-up, making it easier to track progress.
- **Responsive Design**: The game is fully responsive and adapts to various screen sizes, including mobile and tablet devices.

### How to Play

2. **Start the Game**: Click on the "Start Game" button to initiate the game.
3. **Flip Cards**: Click on two cards to reveal the images. If they match, they stay flipped. If they don't, they flip back over after a short delay.
